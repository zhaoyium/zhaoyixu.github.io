# Research

My work centers around engineering tools to model early human embryogenesis.  
Here are my main research directions:

---

## 🔷 1. Acoustic Patterning of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells  
Developing non-invasive acoustic platforms to spatially organize hPSCs into reproducible patterns that mimic early epiblast architecture.  
This system allows us to probe how geometry, mechanics, and signaling cues influence lineage specification.

---

## 🔷 2. Microfluidic Systems for Organoid and Explant Culture  
Designing microfluidic devices that recreate in vivo-like boundary conditions and nutrient flow.  
I use these systems to support long-term human explant culture and to investigate early developmental processes with high-resolution imaging.

## 🔷 3. Human Epiblast Formation & Symmetry Breaking  
Using engineered platforms to study how early symmetry is established or broken during early embryogenesis — focusing on spatial signaling gradients and cell–cell communication.

---

## 🔷 4. Stem-Cell Derived Embryoid Models  
Employing hPSC-derived systems to explore early events in human development that are otherwise inaccessible in vivo.
